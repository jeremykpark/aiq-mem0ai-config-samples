# ðŸŸ© Nvidia AgentIQ toolkit ðŸ”Œ Mem0 Plugin Extended Integration Scripts

These are example scripts for Nvidia AgentIQ for configuring Mem0 with local sources and has been updated for the V2 version of Mem0 with a new plugin integration. This will allow you to run a local Nvidia AgentIQ memory development config, so that your agent will remember your preferences based on your user_id.

This version was setup for Milvus vector store running locally, Mem0 installed locally, and several instances of ollama running locally for embedding and llm commands (need a tool calling model).

This is for demonstration purposes only and not a complete package. You must have the original package for this to work.

## Important Files

* mem0_editor.py - a hevily modified version of the original to support Mem0 V2 API
* memory_local.py - new version for connecting to local resources like local Milvus and Ollama

Mem0 config field list are listed in Mem0_core_configuration_options.md

## Installation plan

These files are ment to be copied into <aiq folder>/packages/aiqtoolkit_mem0ai/src/aiq/plugins/mem0ai  
Best practice not to overwrite the original memory.py and mem0_editor.py incase of future aiq repo updates.  

You will have to add this import to register.py: from . import memory_local_ollama  

Once these files copied into your plugin folder, you'll have to reload to plugin. You can call these configuration by using the following commands:  

Go to the aiqtoolkit_mem0ai plugin main folder, and install like any workflow:  

uv pip install -e .  

To view if it is installed, use the command:  

aiq info components -q "memory" 

## Workflow Config updates

There is a sample config folder that shows how I used the config to setup the file for my local use. Please modify the memory and llm section to point to your local instances.
